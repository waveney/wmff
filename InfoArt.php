This year the Folk Festival has decided to focus on Art as well as our other cultural offerings.  This is being managed by Debbie Underhill who is herself a local abstract artist.  
Debbie is visually impaired and would love to encourage other Artists with a disability to join in.<p>

Allendale House will be the central point for Art @ The Folk Festival, with Allendale Centre also featuring Selected work.<p>

Local artists are being encouraged to participate in either displaying or selling their artwork or carrying out workshops so the public can see how their particular genre of work is produced.<p>

This project is focused on artists who live in Wimborne or within a 5 mile radius.  <p>

This is an exciting venture where individual local artists can be the centre of attention, can promote themselves and learn from each other.<p>

As this is Year 1 we are trying to keep costs to the artist at a minimum and take the opportunity to celebrate Art in Wimborne.<p>

Art also needs volunteers to look after the Art displays (if you are doing both just fill in the Art form above).<p>
