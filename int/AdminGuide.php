<h2>Festival Software Admin Guide</h2>

This is intended for the sysadmin people looking after a festival website, not for general committee/staff members.<p>

<h2>Installation and initial setup</h2>

<ul>
<li>git clone https://github.com/waveney/wmff
<li>Make sure the sites document root is in the php_include_path (it wont work without this).  Also make the maximum file uploads at least 16M (highly desirable).
<li>Set up a mysql or mariadb user (may include a database)
<li>Run int/Initialise.php (from the web interface) - it will first time run prompt for the database user (above), the database name and its host.  
These should be stored, should you need to run again. 
<li>It will create many directories and permissions it needs 
<li>Initialise the database, create the tables and pre-load critical data into a few tables
<li>It will then prompt for a SysAdmin user and password to be user to administer the site (others can be added later)
<li>If sucessful it should eventually launch the staff page.  All other configuration can be setup from this.
</ul><p>

This is under development.  In theory if it fails it can be re-run<p>

<h2>Setting up users</h2>
Under "Users" there is "Add User", it is also at the bottom of the user list.<p>

The main code controls are:<br>
<li>Access(Level,area,detail) - Level is min access level, area if present is edit area required, detail only used for participants.  Returns false if not allowed.
<li>A_Check(Level,area) - hard check - if failed Error_Page called directly, no return

<h2>Initial Data Setup (beyond the first load above)</h2>

<h3>Master Data</h3>
This is data about the festival that is multi-year.<p>

<table border>
<tr><td>Feild<td>Details
<tr><td>Festival Name<td>The full name of the festival - this is needed
<tr><td>Shortname<td>eg WMFF for Wimborne Minster Folk Festival - this is needed
<tr><td>Version<td>Software version number - currently manually updated for every git pull - this is ESSENTIAL keep it up to date - changing this forces reload of cached data by clients.  
Hope to automate it soon.
<tr><td>Show year/ Plan year<td>Show year is what year's festival the public side defaults to.  Plan year is what year the staff pages default to.  
Typically the Plan year moves to the next year as soon as the festival has finished, the Show year only when material for the comming year is available.  
Internally use $YEAR, $PLANYEAR, $SHOWYEAR and $CALYEAR for year being worked on, the plan year, the show year and the actual callenda year.
<tr><td>Host URL<td>This is the host the SMTP will use to send outgoing email.
<tr><td>SMTP user/password<td>This is used for the system to send emails
<tr><td>Features<td>Controls Feature availability - see below
<tr><td>Ads - image and link<td>On public pages an advert can be placed on the left/right of the main banner.  Give the image and links to be followed (if any)
<tr><td>Website Banner<td>The image for the main banner
<tr><td>Analytics code<td>The Javascript to provide Analytics on all pages.  (Don't include the &lt;script&gt;,  just the code to go within)
<tr><td>Google Maps API<td>The API key used to provide Directions on Maps - if not present no directions buttons will appear.  
Note for very large festivals there is a potential cost if used more than Google's free allowance. 
</table><p>

anything else will disappear in time:<p>

<h3>Dance/Music Types</h3>
Setup the dance types you wish to categorise.  Give them a relative importance - order they will apear and give the colour to be used.  Not currently used on the public side.<p>

A similar table may appear for music in time.<p>

<h3>Trade Types and base prices</h3>
This can be setup by staff with Trade access.  The first one is the default<p>
<ul>
<li>Setup the trade types you wish to recognise.
<li>Give them a relative order.
<li>A Colour for the trade type.  (Name or #rgb;)
<li>Give a base price (will say prices from that number), the deposit price, the price can be per day, if so tick the box.
<li>If it is an optional extra element (power) tick additional, (this may not work).
<li>If it is a charity stall tick charity number to enforce the addition of the charity number.
<li>Likewise if it sells food or drink, tick the need local authority.
<li>If insurance is required (it probably is in all cases), tick insurance, likewise risk assesment (mechanism to use this is currently missing).
<li>Artisan Msgs, changes the wording of some trade emails.
<li>Open means submissions are accepted for this type of trade.
<li>The Invoice Code, is the default code specified under Finance to apply to that type of trade, IF the trade location has a code, that will surperced any setting here.
<li>Lastly description is a sentence or two that says what type of trade it is and/or puts restrictions - for example for Wimborne Local Artisan means wiithin 20 miles of Wimborne.
</ul>

Note trade currently works for Saturday/Sunday only.

</ul><p>

Coming soon: Maps for each location to allow click and drag to position traders on the maps<p>


<h3>Event Types</h3>
This has the big controls for event types. DO NOT HAVE TOO MANY OF THESE.  <p>
<ul>
<li>Name - simple broad categorisation - Dancing, Music, Session etc.  Plurall - what ever to include when listing many of the event
<li>Public - If not set these events will never be public.  Typically used for sound checks.
<li>Has Music/Dance/Other - what broad categories it should appear under - used to create Music/Dance/Other event grids.

<li>Set Format to drive EventShow rules 0=All Large, 2=Switch to large at Importance-High, 9+=All Small
<li>State - This is a big control to how and where the events are listed (see also General Year Data for Special/Family):
  <ul>
  <li>Very Early - only seen by staff
  <li>Draft - only seen by staff and participants if they are in that event
  <li>Partial - Seen by the public, but with warnings that not all of this type of event is published
  <li>Provisional - Seen by the public - probably complete
  <li>Complete - seen by the public, no changes are expected
  </ul>
<li>Set Inc Type to indicate event type in description if it is not part of the events name
<li>Set the Not critical flag for sound checks - means that this event type does not have to be complete for contract signing.
<li>Set "No Part" if event type is valid without any participants (note there is a per-event flag that does this as well)
<li>First Year - First year this event type is used at the festival - limits backtracking to show events of previous years beyond this.
</ul>

<h3>Additional Map Points, Map Point Types</h3>
These allow extra information on the festival map, (in addition to the venues)<p>

Map Point Types defines the icons to be used for each additional point.<p>

Additional Map Points:<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>Feild<td>Details
<tr><td>Name<td>Name the map point
<tr><td>What<td>Select type of map point (and hence icon used)
<tr><td>Lat/Long<td>Location of the point - look up locations on Google Maps and record them here (you need at least 3 digits after the decimal points)
<tr><td>Importance<td>This govens the map zoom levels that the feature will be shown at.  The range is from 1 - Whole Earth to 19 very close (20 is street view)<br>
If a single value is used - this is the zoom level when it first appears and it will remain visible however far you zoom in.<br>
If a range is given (eg 14-16) this gives a range of zoom levels that it will be shown
<tr><td>Text Size<td>If set it gives the font size the feature is to be shown at (if not the default)
<tr><td>Not Used<td>If ticked, the Map point will not be shown
<tr><td>Directions<td>Tick if you want to enable a directions buttons to appear for this location
