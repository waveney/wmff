These have information that may be displayed to the public, private information for the festival alone, and details for what they are doing this year.<p>


<h2>Minimum needed</h2>
All Performers need a name.<p>

All performers who are booked need a photo and a short description.<p>

Everything else is optional, but it is highly recommended that all contact information is recorded (even for performers who say no).<p>

<h2>Dance Specific</h2>

<h2>Every other type</h2>


<h2>More Elaborate Stuff</h2>

<h2>Most Complex Stuff</h2>

<h2>Changing the performer type</h2>
Do this with extreeme caution.<p>

To add a performer type - tick the performer type box relevant and click </b>Save Changes</b> this will refresh the page and may change what is displayed.<p>

Removing a performer type should be avoided unless you are certain you can change all events they are doing, as it may leave those events in a messy state, if in doubt ask Richard.<p>
