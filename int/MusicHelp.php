<h2>Introduction</h2>
Expanding the database to handle Music was a larger task than I originally thought, when I realised that Music is booked in a different way to
how Dance Sides are booked, so rather than try to change the Dance booking for Music I wrote Music Booking as a largely seperate system.  
It is work in progress at this point.<p> 

Headings that are not yet links on the Staff page, will become working features as they are written.<p>

<h2>Basic Operation</h2>
From Music you can Add Acts to the database, generate contracts, get them recorded, confirmed, changed and all details about an Act can be maintained.
In the near future a visual representation of the Music will be presented and possibly manipulated to aid in managing the whole programme.<p>

Under Venues and Events, Venues can be added, and managed (rarely needed).  Also Events can be setup, changed, divided into sub events and checked for consistency.
An Event may be a Concert, a Ceildih, a sound check (or anything else).  A large event such as concert may be divided into sub events to allow for managing the timing
of individual elements.<p>

Most of the material (if not all) for the printed programme, publicity posters, the public side of the website will all come straight out of the database.<p>
