<div class=content><h2>FAQ for Dance Teams at Wimborne in 2019</h2>

<dl class=WMFF_FAQ>
<dt>Partner wristbands<dd>will be available at half price.  We're still working on the best way to pay for them, but let us know if you'll need any.

<dt>Evening dance spots<dd>If you'd like to dance in the evening either in the ceilidh spot, 
or in the Cornmarket just tick the appropriate box on the dance side record and we'll see if we can sort something out.

<dt>Arriving late/Leaving early?<dd>Please tell us if there are any times that
you will be unavailable for dance spots and we'll allow for that in your programme.  

<dt>How many dance spots?<dd> Each Appalachian side will normally be allotted three
half hour spots during the day. Morris sides will normally get four shared half hour
spots (or three dance spots plus the procession on Saturday), but all teams are
welcome to request extra spots by changing the number in the box in their dance side record.

<dt>Shared musicians (or dancers)<dd>If you share musicians or dancers with another
team coming to Wimborne (or you have members appearing in our concerts, etc) then
let us know what the overlaps are and we'll ensure your programming takes account of this.

<dt>Camping<dd>We don't run our own campsite, but highly recommend 'The Meadows' which
is only a few minutes walk from the town centre.  See <a href=../InfoCamping>Camping
Information</a>

<dt>Car parking<dd> If you are using the Meadows camp site, then you can leave your
car there, as it's a very short walk into the town centre. There are many car parks
around town, including a popular one run by Allenbourne School. 

<dt>Wristbands<dd> We will mail out performers'  wristbands shortly before the
festival.  Performers wristbands give free entry to all offical fetival events 
(excluding anything at the Tivoli), provided there is
space available.  They may also get you into the Party in the Paddock.  
Make sure you have a postal address on your dance side record, for us to mail your wristbands to.<p>

Performers wristbands are not transferable.  If your team have to cancel, please post all wristbands
back to: Judith Proctor, 28 Diprose rd, Corfe Mullen, Wimborne, Dorset BH21 3QY.

<dt>Insurance<dd> In the New Year, when you new insurance certificates arrive, 
please upload a copy of your <?php $PLANYEAR ?> public liability insurance to your dance side record.


<dt>Would you be interested in running a workshop?<dd> If you are, contact
<a href=mailto:dance@wimbornefolk.co.uk>dance@wimbornefolk.co.uk</a>
and we'll see if we can arrange a suitable time and place.

<dt>Collecting<dd>Please pick up a collecting tin from the Festival Information in the Square before your first 
dance spot and return it there when you've finished dancing.  There will be a cash prize for the team with the best collection.

<dt>If you have any problems at the festival<dd>Ask anyone with a radio (festival
information,etc.) to call Judith or Richard Proctor.  You can try our mobiles
07759 784901 or 07718 511432, but remember we'll be spending most of our time
next to loud morris bands and may not hear a mobile ringing. Radios should reach
us when phones fail.  You can contact Festival Information (who will have radios)
in the Square.

<dt>Timekeeping<dd> Don't run past the end of your timeslot, even if something caused it to start late.  
Running late is unfair to the team after you (even if the late start was not your fault).  
If you feel you've missed out, please contact Richard or Judith and we'll see if I can find you an extra spot somwewhere.


<dt>Emergency Number<dd> We need an emergency mobile number so that we can contact
you during the festival in the case of accidents/people getting lost/etc.
Please enter it on your dance side record.

<dt>Blurb<dd>If you'd like to write something about your side for our website:
history, where you meet, details of dances, etc. please put whatever you like
in the <b>blurb field</b>. Do NOT edit the <b>description</b> field, unless the
kit details are wrong - this is a <b>spotters's guide</b> for our programme book
and has to be very short.

<dt>Procession<dd>The only procession is on Saturday. The procession starts just
beyond the Cricketers and the Rising Sun and ends just beyond the Square. Start
lining up for the procession along Park Lane at 2pm. The procession will begin
moving at 2:30.  When you reach the end, please salute the mayor.  Your position
in the procession will appear in your dance side record on the web.

<!--<dt>Procession Route.<dd>We may be changing the procession route this year, in
order to avoid the problem of dancing past stalls encroaching on the route. 
The proposed new route is longer, but less cluttered. -->

<dt>Rapper Dancers<dd>We're only expecting rapper teams to do one street spot
per day. The rest of the time you can free range in the town's pubs. The programme
book will have a list of pubs and local businesses that are supporting the festival.

<dt>Appalachian dancers<dd>Please arrive a few minutes early so you can sort out any specific needs with the sound engineer, 
and allow 5 mins for band set up in your dance programme. 
Bring your own jack leads to plug into our equipment and your own anti-slip agent.

<dt>Wet Weather<dd>If it rains and you want to carry on dancing, head for the
Town Hall/Council Chambers where space has been reserved for dancing. Or if
you can find a friendly pub/church/tea room with enough space, just ask
their permission and dance anywhere you like.

<dt>Photograph<dd>If you have a good recent photograph of your side (and we
don't yet have a good one of you), then please link to it or upload it via
the dance side record.

<dt>Solo or Shared Dance Spots?<dd>There is a box to tick to show if you
prefer to do a half hour spot on your own, or to share your half hour spot alternating with another team.

<dt>Children<dd>All Children's events at the festival are free.

<dt>Workshops<dd>All Workshops are free.

<dt>Pubs<dd>All Festival events in pubs are free.

<dt>Sessions<dd> All Sessions are free.

<dt>Music<dd> All Music on Willow Walk, the Square and in the Microbreweries is free.

<dt>Map<dd>A Map of all festival venues can be found <a href=/Map>Here</a> and Map of just the dance locations is <a href=/Map?F=3>Here</a>.
