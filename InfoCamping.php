Our official campsite is run by Meadows Camping, a picturesque, local, secure, well managed temporary campsite for the folk festival weekend. 
The site is just a 10 minute walk from the town centre over Julian's bridge.<p>

Camping at Meadows Campsite this year is <strong>&#163;7.50</strong> per person per night (+ booking fee) when booked in 
advance online or <strong>&#163;8.50</strong> per person per night on the gate. Under 10's are free.<p>

The site has toilets, showers, food and good 24 hour security. Entry to the campsite is by camping wristband only.<p>

Please be aware that access to/from the town on foot is over Julian's bridge, which has no footpath, so please take care when crossing at all times.</p>
