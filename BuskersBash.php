Each year, buskers from around the country travel to Wimborne to
compete in the annual Buskers Bash. Organised by the committee of
Wimborne Minster Folk Festival, you can find the sound of traditional
street entertainment at various venues throughout the town including
The Square, The Library and The Oddfellows Arms.<p>

Members of the public can purchase tokens on the day (at a cost of &pound;1
for 10) to show their support for their favourite artists and all of these
votes will be counted and combined with a judges’ total to decide the
winner.<p>

Participants will compete this year for a cash prize (&pound;100 Winner and
&pound;50 to the Runner Up) and the winner will be invited to perform on the
Willow Walk Stage during the 2019 Folk Festival. It promises to be a
thrilling competition.<p>
