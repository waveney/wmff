<h3>Comedy at Wimborne Minster Folk Festival</h3>
Are you funny? Do you want a chance to prove it - on stage, in front of a warm, supportive
audience? If your answer is "YES!" then our "Laugh Out Loud" New Act Competition is just
right for you.<P>

This year Wimborne Minster Folk Festival includes comedy in its program with "Laugh Out Loud", its
New Act Comedy Competition, culminating in the final on Friday June 8 th - at which the finalists will
appear on the same bill as a top UK Comedy Circuit headliner (more on that soon).<p>

<h3>Want to know more?</h3>
With cash prizes and an appearance at Wimborne Comedy Club on offer there's lots to aim for.
Successful applicants will be invited to one of three heats to be held in Wimborne.<p>

There will be a maximum of 12 entrants in each heat - only 36 people will be accepted into the
competition (we will run a reserve list in case of drop outs).<p>

The top 2 from each heat will go forward into the final.<p>

All heats will begin at 8pm in The Wimborne RBL Club, West Borough, Wimborne Minster BH21 1LT.<p>

<ul>
<li> Heat 1 will be held on Tuesday March 6th.
<li> Heat 2 will be held on Tuesday April 10th.
<li> Heat 3 will be held on Tuesday May 1st.
</ul>

During the heats and the final each slot will be 8 minutes long.<p>

If you make it to the final your material can be the same as used in your heat but that's not a rule -
you're encouraged to give us your "best 8" at all times.<p>

<b>Audience entry to the heats will be free entry, pay what you want on exit</b> - all money collected at
the heat will be split between the acts remaining in the room at the end of the night.<p>

Audience entry at the final will be by ticket (available in advance or on the door if available,
advance ticket details TBC).<p>

All money raised from tickets sales will go towards the running costs of the competition and of the
Wimborne Minster Folk Festival. There are no further fees or expenses payable to competition
entrants, except for the cash prizes.<p>

<b>Judging of the heats</b> will be done by a mixture of audience voting and judges scoring. Heat results
will be announced on the night and those going through to the final will be emailed for confirmation.<p>

<b>Judging of the final</b> will be done solely by a panel of judges, including local comedy promoter
Richard Jay.<p>

All material should be original and the creation of the entrant. Plagiarism will be penalised.<p>

<h3>What can we win?</h3>
